# Network Automation Project with Python and Ansible

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate how to use Python and Ansible to create a scalable network infrastructure that includes virtual machines (VMs) and containers. Network automation is crucial for managing modern, complex network environments efficiently.

In this project, we will focus on creating a network that scales easily, deploys VMs, and manages containers. We'll be using Python for scripting and Ansible for automation tasks. This README will guide you through the setup and execution of the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python: You'll need Python installed on your machine.
- Ansible: Install Ansible, a powerful automation tool, on your system.
- Virtualization Platform: Depending on your choice, set up a virtualization platform such as VirtualBox, VMware, or others.
- Container Platform: Install a container platform like Docker or Kubernetes, as per your requirements.
